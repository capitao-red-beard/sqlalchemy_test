This is a very basic script showing how to get started in Python with the SQLAlchemy library

## How to get started

1. Clone this repo  
2. Create a virtual environment by navigating to the project in terminal and executing command: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment by navigating to the project folder in terminal and executing command: `source venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Again in the project folder use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
